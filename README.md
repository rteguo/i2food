# i2food : improve the impact of food
project to create an e-commerce platform for the sale of fresh food products
The foods we consume daily have an impact on our health, and this impact can be negative due to their composition. Therefore, it is essential for individuals to have access to the nutritional information of the foods they choose to consume.
In this project, I designed and implemented an e-commerce platform for the sale of fresh food products. In the customer journey, customers have the option to review the nutritional information of each food item before placing an order. 
We use Ninja's nutrition API (https://api-ninjas.com/api/nutrition) as our source of information for the nutritional composition of the products.
The technologies that I used are :
- Database : Postgre
- Server : Flask, SQLAlchemy, Python
- Client : HTML/CSS/Js, Bootstrap, Jinja, AJAX
- Tools: GitHub, VSCode, draw.io, Trello, MS Project
