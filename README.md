# i2food : improve the impact of food
project to create an e-commerce platform for the sale of fresh food products
The foods we consume daily have an impact on our health, and this impact can be negative due to their composition. Therefore, it is essential for individuals to have access to the nutritional information of the foods they choose to consume.
In this project, I designed and implemented an e-commerce platform for the sale of fresh food products. In the customer journey, customers have the option to review the nutritional information of each food item before placing an order. 
We use Ninja's nutrition API (https://api-ninjas.com/api/nutrition) as our source of information for the nutritional composition of the products.

The technologies used are :
- Database : Postgre
- Server : Flask, SQLAlchemy, Python
- Client : HTML/CSS/Js, Bootstrap, Jinja, AJAX
- Tools: GitHub, VSCode, draw.io, Trello, MS Project
  
The customer journey includes several stages, including the consultation of essential information about products available for purchase. Customers can add products to their shopping cart directly from the shop page or view the details of each product. These details include a detailed description of the nutritional composition of the product, which customers can also print. Once they have completed their selection, customers can proceed to validate their order.
The platform also includes a content management system that allows the administrator to review orders approved by customers, along with all associated details. The administrator can also access the product database, make changes to product information, and add new products.
I would like to express my gratitude to the entire team of mentors at Hackbright Academy for their training, guidance, and support throughout this project.
